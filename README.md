# Librarium
A book search web application interacts with the Google Books API.

With Librarium you can:
- Find ebooks from all over the world
- Narrow your search with the advanced search feature
- Ð¡onveniently view the selection with pagination
- View detailed information about the book
- Buy, read online and download books
- Sort and store selected books in your library

I used HTML, SASS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, some plugins, AJAX, and Parcel for building the project.
