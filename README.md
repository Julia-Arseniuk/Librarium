# Librarium
A book search web application interacts with the Google Books API.

With Librarium you can:
- Find ebooks from all over the world
- Narrow your search with the advanced search feature
- Ð¡onveniently view the selection with pagination
- View detailed information about the book
- Buy, read online and download books
- Sort and store selected books in your personal library

I used HTML, SASS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, some plugins, AJAX, and Parcel for building the project.

## Note
Since I was faced with the quota theft, I am forced to limit the use of the API key to a website or IP address.
But query parameters and fragments are not currently supported and github-pages format is not supported too.

Therefore, unfortunately, it is not yet possible to fully demonstrate all functionality. 

- You could write me so that I can allow your IP address to use API key. Or
- You could create your own API key to authenticate to Google Cloud APIs
